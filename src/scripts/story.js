// to make a titled locatin, set the giveLocation option to a key name of a room. That location will then send the player to that room. You can set multiple rooms to the same location
// so you could have lighthouse1, lighthouse2, but have them all give "lighthouse". This way it will show you that you're in a lighthouse.

// to make a choice influence the current room, set the starting path to the same room. set the alter path to the new room with a new description, and overwrite the og path.
