            Left Munich at 8:35 P.M., on 1st May, arriving at Vienna 
            early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an hour late. 
            Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I got of it from 
            the train and the little I could walk through the streets. I feared to go very far 
            from the station, as we had arrived late and would start as near the correct time 
            as possible.

            The impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the 
            East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is here of 
            noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish rule.
